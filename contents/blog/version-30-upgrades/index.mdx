## Marquez 30.0

[Marquez 30.0](https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez/releases/tag/0.30.0), 
which we released on January 31, contains some exciting new features, including 
[column-level lineage](https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez/pull/2293) and 
a [soft delete option](https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez/pull/2343) in 
the UI.

Along with these long-awaited UI upgrades come some significant performance 
improvements to the API. In prior versions of Marquez, accessing OpenLineage 
facets required direct queries against the OpenLineage events table, which could 
be quite costly depending on the size of this table. Some users have events 
tables with more than 100K rows. To address this performance issue, Marquez 30.0 
has new tables for dataset, job and run facets.

So far, so simple, right? Protecting against data loss and ensuring a smooth 
experience for users was not so simple, in fact. We needed a way to migrate the 
data while not only avoiding loss but also keeping downtime to a minimum. The 
solution that [Willy](https://github.com/wslulciuc) and 
[Pawel](https://github.com/pawel-big-lebowski) found (with input from 
[Mike Collado](https://github.com/collado-mike)) was to keep the data in the 
events table until the migration process is complete and to create views on top 
of the table for accessing the facets. After migration is complete, the views 
are replaced to point to the new tables. Using views provides safeguards and 
minimizes downtime during the migration. 

## Migration Procedure

As the 
[migration plan](https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez/blob/main/api/src/main/resources/marquez/db/migration/V57__readme.md) 
says, users whose `lineage_events` tables have up to 100K rows can set it and 
forget it -- no extra work is required beyond upgrading and restarting 
Marquez, but be prepared for a brief downtime while a standard Flyway migration 
fills the newly created tables automatically.

For heavy users whose `lineage_events` tables have more than 100K rows, a 
different process will be used. Instead of a standard migration, the process will 
happen asynchronously so that the user can start the API and consume new 
OpenLineage events as usual. Note that some API calls might return irrelevant 
results during the migration, especially if the output is based on facets.

To perform a migration, these users must run the following command:

```
java -jar api/build/libs/marquez-api-0.30.0-SNAPSHOT.jar db-migrate --version v57 ./marquez.yml
```

The command will process the data in chunks, storing a state with information 
about the chunks being processed. Consequently,

- it can be stopped any time
- it will continue automatically and process the remaining chunks. 

The default chunk size, 10,000, refers to the number of `lineage_events` 
processed in a single query. The chunk size may be adjusted via command parameter:

```
java -jar api/build/libs/marquez-api-0.30.0-SNAPSHOT.jar db-migrate --version v57 --chunkSize 50000 ./marquez.yml
```
